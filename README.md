# Hexamon Hunt Automation 🐾

Namaste Hexamon fam! This is my chill Node.js script to automate `/hunt` in our Telegram Pokémon game, Hexamon. I built it for fun, and it’s helped me grab 1000-1200 PD per day in tests—pretty cool, na? It hunts Pokémon with human-like delays and sometimes skips to keep it natural. Check it out and let me know your vibe!

## What It Does
- Sends `/hunt` automatically to find Pokémon.
- Fights or catches them with smart moves (human-like timing, not too fast!).
- Sometimes skips hunts to avoid looking like a bot.
- Earns 1000-1200 PD daily (based on my runs).

## How to Use
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your computer.
2. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Hexamon-Hunt-Automation.git`
3. Go to the folder: `cd Hexamon-Hunt-Automation`
4. Run `npm install` to get the needed stuff.
5. Get your Telegram API ID and Hash from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org/).
6. Update `.env` with your details (see `.env.example` below for help).
7. Start it: `node Automation.js` (it’ll ask for your phone number if `.env` isn’t set).
8. Sit back—it’ll hunt for you!

## Requirements
- Node.js
- Telegram account
- Packages: `telegram`, `input` (installed via `npm install`)
- A `.env` file (check below)

## Setup `.env`
Create a `.env` file in the project folder and add your API details like this: 

- API_ID=your_api_id_here

Copy this, rename it to `.env`, and fill in your values from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org/). Don’t share this file—it’s your secret key!
